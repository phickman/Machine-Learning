function g = sigmoid(z)
%SIGMOID Compute sigmoid functoon
%   J = SIGMOID(z) computes the sigmoid of z.

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
g = zeros(size(z));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the sigmoid of each value of z (z can be a matrix,
%               vector or scalar).


% For large positive values of x, the sigmoid should be close to 1, while for large
% negative values, the sigmoid should be close to 0. Evaluating sigmoid(0)
% should give you exactly 0.5. Your code should also work with vectors and
% matrices. For a matrix, your function should perform the sigmoid
% function on every element.
